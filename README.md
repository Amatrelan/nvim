# Nvim

Quite heavily modified version of Kickstart, but a ~lot~ _some_ of originals is there still too.

## [Kickstart](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim)
I recommend to start there, it's a good baseline and has all important things already up for you. So you can configure your nvim config with nvim easily.

```rust
fn main() {
    println!("Hello World");
}
```
